## <span style="font-size:26pt;">External Storage Solutions</span>

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD)

As **external storage** solutions, both HDD and SSD are popular choices. Their performance and comparison are identical to the **internal versions**. Which is used depends on the requirements of the user.

**When to use external storage:**
- If you require **quick file transfers, backups** and a portable solution that is less likely to be impacted by being carried around, **SSDs** are the best choice
- If you need to do **extensive backups, store media files or transport large files**, but speed is less critical, you may decide an **HDD** is the better option

### Optical Discs and Optical Drives

Optical drives that read/write optical discs, such as **CDs, DVDs** or **Blu-Rays**, are becoming less popular, but are still a consideration for **external media storage**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The cost of an optical disc is low compared to an HDD or SSD
- Their read/write speeds may be slower
- They are sufficient for data archiving and playback
- However, the discs are prone to scratches, especially if they are not stored correctly
- They require an optical drive to read and write to them
- These are becoming less common in devices these days

### Memory Cards

**Memory cards** are compact storage devices often used in cameras, smartphones and other portable devices. They are ideal for expanding storage in mobile devices and for storing photos and videos on cameras, using **NAND flash memory**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Come in multiple sizes, such as SD, microSD and CompactFlash
- Cater to different device and space requirements
- Known for their **durability** – resistant to physical shocks, extreme temperatures and water
- Making them ideal for portable devices
- Their read/write times are generally slower than SSD and optical discs

### Network Attached Storage (NAS)

**NAS** is a dedicated file storage connected to a **network** that allows multiple users to access data.

**Key Features:**
- It serves as a central hub for businesses for **centralizing data storage and data backup**
- NAS is usually made up of **multiple HDDs or SSDs** configured in **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)** configuration
- It is normally connected to the network via **Ethernet**
- Runs a lightweight operating system designed for file sharing and the management and sharing of files
- As it uses multiple HDDs or SSDs, its capacity is usually high
- It is possible to expand the system further by adding additional drives

#### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

**RAID** is a data storage technology that combines multiple physical disks (HDDs or SSDs) into a single logical unit to improve performance, provide redundancy and ensure data protection.

## <span style="font-size:26pt;">Data Compression</span>

**Compression** is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Making file sizes smaller has two main advantages:

1. It takes **less room on secondary storage**
2. It is **faster to transmit across a network**

There are two main types of compression: **lossless** and **lossy**.

![Compression Types](./images/compression-types.png)

---

### Lossless vs Lossy Compression

#### Lossless Compression

**Lossless compression** is when data is compressed to a smaller size, but can be restored back to the original without any loss of information. This is important for files such as **text files and databases**, where a loss of information would be critical.

**How it works:**
- This technique works by identifying and removing **statistical redundancy**
- Repeated information within a data set that does not add to its uniqueness
- This process can be reversed when needed

**Example:** Lossy compression generally outperforms lossless compression when it comes to file sizes; however, it reduces files by permanently eliminating certain information. This information is identical to the original but is, ideally, indistinguishable from the original to human senses.

---

#### Lossy Compression

**Lossy compression** is commonly used for compressing **multimedia files** such as images, audio and video, where some loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for significantly reduced file sizes.

**Visual Example:**

While it may be pretty difficult to visually distinguish the difference in quality, the lossy version uses **90 per cent less data** than the original.

![Lossy Compression Comparison](./images/lossy-comparison.png)

| Original | Lossless | Saved | Lossy | Saved |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1.73 MB | 1.58 MB | 9% | 886 KB | 50% |

---

### Run-length Encoding (RLE)

**Run-length encoding** is an effective data-compression technique used to reduce the size of files containing many consecutive repeated characters.

**Example:**

Take this string:
```
AAAAABBBBCCDAA
```

RLE looks for **"runs"** where a character is repeated. In the example above, we have five runs:

```
AAAAA BBB CC D AA
```

The RLE algorithm identified the run by replacing it with a pair: **the character that repeats and the number of repetitions**. So, the runs above become:

```
5A 3B 2C 1D 2A
```

The encoded string is then stored as:
```
5A3B2C1D2A
```

**Calculation:**

If we assume each letter stores **8 bits** of information, the initial data is **13 × 8 = 104 bits**, or **13 bytes**.

After compressing with RLE, the data is **10 × 8 = 80 bits** or **10 bytes** – a **23 per cent reduction** in size.

**When RLE is effective:**
- RLE is straightforward to implement and is very effective for **data with lots of repetitions**
- Such as simple graphics and certain types of text files
- RLE was often used on **fax machines**, which would send text documents via the telephone line
- This was because they contained a lot of white space, which meant RLE could achieve compression ratios of up to **8:1**

However, for data that does not contain many repeated characters, like a portrait photograph, RLE may not be very effective. In some cases, it may even **increase the file size**.

## <span style="font-size:26pt;">Transform Coding</span>

**Transform coding** is a form of lossy compression often used in **JPEG image compression** or **MP3 audio compression**.

![Transform Coding Stages](./images/transform-coding.png)

Using JPEG compression as an example:

### Stage 1: Construct n × n sub-images
**Transform coding** takes an image of **N × N** size and sections it into smaller **sub-images** of size **n × n**.

### Stage 2: Forward Transform
Then the **forward transform** is carried out on each of the sub-images. The forward transform can use different algorithms, depending on the type of file compression, but for **JPEGs** the **DCT (discrete cosine transform)** is used.

This takes the image data from the **spatial domain (pixel values)** to the **frequency domain**. The output breaks the sub-image down into **low- and high-frequency coefficients**.

#### Low-frequency data
Correspond to slow changes in pixel values, representing broad areas.

#### High-frequency data
Correspond to rapid changes in pixel values, representing fine details, edges, and textures.

---

### Stage 3: Quantizer

These frequency coefficients are then passed to the **quantizer**. This step significantly **reduces the precision of high-frequency components** (the fine details) rather than low-frequency components.

This is because the human eye is **less sensitive to high-frequency detail** compared to low-frequency detail. The extent of the quantization determines the compression level and the quality of the final image.

---

### Stage 4: Symbol Encoder

The final step of transform coding is the **symbol encoder**. This is where the quantized coefficients are further compressed using **entropy coding techniques**. This runs through three further algorithms to reduce the file size by efficiently representing the frequency of occurrence of each symbol. The algorithms used at this stage are (in this order):

1. **Zigzag scan**
2. **Run-length encoding (RLE)**
3. **Huffman coding**

Once this stage has finished, the final compressed image is complete.

## Practice Questions WITH Model Answers

### Question 1
**What are the two main advantages of compressing files?**

**Model Answer:**  
1. It takes less room on secondary storage
2. It is faster to transmit across a network

Both advantages save time and resources.

---

### Question 2
**Explain the difference between lossless and lossy compression.**

**Model Answer:**  
- **Lossless compression:** Data is compressed to a smaller size but can be restored to the original without any loss of information. This is important for text files and databases.
- **Lossy compression:** Permanently eliminates certain information to achieve smaller file sizes. Used for multimedia files (images, audio, video) where some quality loss is acceptable.

---

### Question 3
**How does run-length encoding (RLE) work, and in what types of files is it most effective?**

**Model Answer:**  
RLE works by identifying "runs" where a character is repeated and replacing them with a pair: the character and the number of repetitions. For example, "AAAAA" becomes "5A".

RLE is most effective for files with lots of repetitions, such as:
- Simple graphics
- Text files with repeated characters
- Fax documents (which contain lots of white space)

---

### Question 4
**Describe the process of transform coding in JPEG image compression and explain why it is considered a lossy compression method.**

**Model Answer:**  
Transform coding involves four stages:
1. **Construct sub-images:** Image is divided into smaller n × n blocks
2. **Forward transform:** DCT converts pixel data from spatial to frequency domain
3. **Quantizer:** Reduces precision of high-frequency components (fine details)
4. **Symbol encoder:** Further compresses using entropy coding (zigzag scan, RLE, Huffman coding)

It's considered lossy because the quantizer permanently removes high-frequency detail that the human eye is less sensitive to, meaning the original cannot be perfectly restored.

---

### Question 5
**What are the primary differences between external HDDs and external SSDs, and when would you choose one over the other?**

**Model Answer:**  
**Differences:**
- SSDs are faster, more durable, lighter, and generate less heat/noise
- HDDs are cheaper per GB and available in larger capacities

**When to choose:**
- **SSD:** For quick file transfers, backups, and portable use where durability matters
- **HDD:** For extensive backups and large file storage where speed is less critical

---
