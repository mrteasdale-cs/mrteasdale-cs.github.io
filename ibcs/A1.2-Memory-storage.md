## <span style="font-size:26pt;">Types of Primary Memory</span>

### RAM (Random Access Memory)

**RAM** holds instructions and data for programs that are currently running. For example, when you open an app on your phone or computer, it loads into RAM so that it can be accessed quickly by the CPU.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Volatile:** Loses all data when power is turned off
- Used for temporary storage during program execution
- Fast access speeds

**Real-world example:** When playing a game, you lose your progress unless you save the game (which is then stored in secondary memory). RAM allows quick switching between apps on smartphones.

### ROM (Read-Only Memory)

**ROM** is used for storing instructions that are very rarely modified. ROM is used for the BIOS (basic input/output system) of the computer, which is located on the motherboard.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Non-volatile:** Does not lose contents when power is off
- Cannot easily change its data (most modern computers use flash memory)
- Stores firmware and boot instructions

**BIOS Role:**
- Initialize and test system hardware components on startup
- Load the operating system (OS) software from secondary memory storage into RAM

**Real-world example:** ROM stores the operating system and core applications in smartphones. This ensures your phone can boot up reliably every time.

### Cache Memory (L1, L2, and L3)

**Cache memory** is small but provides high-speed access to the CPU compared to RAM. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the slower RAM, storing frequently used data and instructions.

![Cache Diagram](./images/cache-diagram.png)

There are three levels of cache: **L1, L2, and L3**, each with different sizes and speeds. The closer to the CPU, the faster it is:

#### L1 Cache
- Located **directly on the CPU**, making it the fastest type of cache
- Smallest in size (32KB to 128KB per core)
- Split into two sections: L1i (instructions) and L1d (data)

#### L2 Cache
- Either on the CPU or situated very close to the CPU
- Larger than L1 (256KB to 2MB per core)
- Faster than L3, but slightly slower than L1
- Provides more storage for frequently used instructions

#### L3 Cache
- Shared on multiple-core CPUs
- Largest of the three types (2MB to 64MB shared across all cores)
- Slowest of the three, but still significantly faster than RAM

---

### Cache Hit vs Cache Miss

- **Cache hit:** When the CPU requests data and it is found in the cache memory. This is the ideal scenario.
- **Cache miss:** When the CPU requests data and it is **not** found in the cache memory, necessitating retrieval from the slower main memory (RAM) or even slower storage (SSD / HDD).

The percentage that measures cache efficiency determines how well the system runs. Systems with more intelligent prefetching techniques can predict which data will be needed soon and load it into cache ahead of time.

---

### Optimizing CPU Performance with Cache

The cache plays a critical role in ensuring that the CPU can access data as quickly as possible. When the CPU finds the searched-for data in the cache (a **cache hit**), the data can be processed very quickly. However, when there is a **cache miss**, the CPU has to look for the data in the slower memory, which slows down processing.

**Example:** Imagine you are playing a video game on a computer. The CPU frequently checks the L1, L2, and L3 cache to find the data it needs to run the game smoothly. The game's core functions, such as player controls and game logic, might be stored in the L1 cache, while the less frequently accessed data, such as background textures, may be in the L3 cache. The layering system helps to ensure that the game runs smoothly without interruptions.

---

### Top Tip: The Onion Analogy

Imagine an onion with its layers representing the levels of cache:

- **L1 cache** is the smallest and fastest, like the very centre of the onion, where everything is tightly packed to the CPU.
- **L2 cache** is slightly larger and slower, like the next layer out – still close to the centre, but not as quick to access as the very core.
- **L3 cache** is the largest and slowest, like the outer layers of the onion. It's still important, but it takes a bit longer to get to, just like how the CPU takes a bit more time to access data in L3 cache compared to L1 and L2.

### Internal Storage

#### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

HDDs are older technology but are still often used, especially in non-mobile devices. They are affordable compared to the amount of storage they offer.

**How HDDs work:**
- Utilize a **spinning magnetic disk** to read/write data
- Suitable for storing large volumes of data, such as media files, backups, and documents, where speed is not critical

![HDD Internals](./images/hdd-diagram.png)

**Key Features:**
- Magnetic storage with spinning disks and read/write heads
- Slower read/write speeds (50–150 MB/s)
- More prone to physical damage due to moving parts
- Produces noise due to moving parts
- Higher power usage due to mechanical parts
- Generally cheaper per GB
- Available in larger capacities (up to several TB)
- Heavier due to mechanical components
- Generates more heat due to moving parts

---

#### Solid State Drive (SSD)

SSDs have no moving parts. They use **flash memory** to store data, offering high-speed data access and durability.

**Key Features:**
- Flash memory with no moving parts
- Faster read/write speeds (generally 200–500 MB/s)
- More durable; resistant to physical shock
- Silent operation
- Lower power consumption
- More expensive per GB
- Typically available in smaller capacities (up to several TB, but at a higher cost)
- Lighter
- Generates less heat

## Practice Questions WITH Model Answers

### Question 1
**What is the main purpose of RAM in a computer system, and why is it considered volatile?**

**Model Answer:**  
RAM (Random Access Memory) holds instructions and data for programs that are currently running. It allows the CPU to quickly access the information it needs. RAM is considered **volatile** because it loses all its data when the computer is powered off. This is why unsaved work is lost during a power outage.

---

### Question 2
**How does ROM differ from RAM in terms of its function and volatility?**

**Model Answer:**  
ROM (Read-Only Memory) stores permanent instructions, such as the BIOS, that are rarely modified. Unlike RAM, ROM is **non-volatile**, meaning it retains its data even when the computer is turned off. ROM cannot be easily changed, whereas RAM is constantly being read from and written to during normal operation.

---

### Question 3
**Why is cache memory important for CPU performance, and how do the different levels of cache memory (L1, L2, L3) vary in terms of speed and size?**

**Model Answer:**  
Cache memory is important because it provides high-speed access to frequently used data, reducing the need to fetch data from slower RAM. The three levels vary as follows:
- **L1 cache:** Smallest and fastest, located directly on the CPU
- **L2 cache:** Larger and slightly slower, either on the CPU or very close
- **L3 cache:** Largest and slowest of the three, shared across multiple cores

The closer the cache is to the CPU, the faster it is.

---

### Question 4
**What happens during a cache hit and a cache miss, and how do these events impact system performance?**

**Model Answer:**  
- A **cache hit** occurs when the CPU finds the data it needs in the cache, allowing for very fast processing.
- A **cache miss** occurs when the data is not in the cache, forcing the CPU to retrieve it from slower RAM or storage, which slows down processing.

Systems with higher cache hit rates perform better because data retrieval is much faster.

---

### Question 5
**What are the primary differences between an HDD and an SSD in terms of performance and durability?**

**Model Answer:**  
- **Performance:** SSDs have faster read/write speeds (200–500 MB/s) compared to HDDs (50–150 MB/s) because they use flash memory with no moving parts.
- **Durability:** SSDs are more durable and resistant to physical shock, while HDDs are more prone to damage due to their spinning disks and mechanical components.

SSDs are ideal for portable devices and applications requiring fast data access.

---

### Question 6
**Why might a low-cost device, such as an entry-level smartphone, use eMMC storage instead of an SSD?**

**Model Answer:**  
eMMC (Embedded MultiMediaCard) storage is cheaper than SSDs and adequate for basic computing needs. While it doesn't match the capacity or speed of SSDs, it provides sufficient performance for simple applications, making it ideal for budget devices where cost is a primary concern.
